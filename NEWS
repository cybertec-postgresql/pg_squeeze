Release 1.0.2
=============

Bug fixes
---------

1. Close pg_class relation and its scan if exiting early (i.e. catalog change
   was detected).

2. Defend against race conditions that allow for applying of the concurrent
   changes which have already been captured by the initial load. In such a
   case the squeeze_table() function can raise ERROR due to attempt to insert
   duplicate value of identity key, or due to failure to update or delete row
   that no longer exists.

3. Use the correct snapshot for the initial load.

   So far the squeeze_table() function could have used an obsolete snapshot if
   some transaction(s) started after the snapshot builder reached
   SNAPBUILD_FULL_SNAPSHOT state and committed before
   SNAPBUILD_CONSISTENT. Both the initial load and the logical decoding used
   to miss such transactions.

   This problem could only happen after the bug fix #2 had been
   implemented. Before that at least the logical decoding captured the
   problematic transactions because it (the decoding) started earlier than
   necessary.

   No data loss was reported so far, but we still recommend you to upgrade
   pg_squeeze to the version that includes this fix.

   Note: This problem could only be fixed for PostgreSQL of version 9.6.3 or
   later. Therefore we no longer support pg_squeeze for versions 9.6.2 or
   earlier.

4. Do not use "initial load memory context" to fetch tuples from table or
   index.

   If the load takes place in multiple "batches" (i.e. tuplesort is not used),
   that memory context gets freed before the next batch starts and the call fo
   squeeze_table() function results in SEGFAULT.

5. Do not close relation cache entry for index if some field is yet to be
   accessed.

6. Include composite types in the checks of concurrent catalog changes. If
   table has a column of a composite data type and the type is altered during
   the squeeze, the squeeze_table() function raises ERROR.
